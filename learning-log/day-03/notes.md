## Third Day's notes:

## Log-1:

On a more unprofessional note, I started off the day slow and thus didn't even have time to push anything to the project, as a result on the commit history Thursday the 13th is sadly empty. Good news is I started up on OpenGL, bad news is I started up on OpenGL. I have been unsuccesful in finding decent material to study on it and I will most likely resort to buying some of the books. The project is simple, test out some interactions with the window so it is not as blank as it is now but more on that tomorrow. This however as a result will help me finish the hard part of the Pathfinding visualisation. I am also hoping that instead of using OpenGL at somepoint maybe I can copy the project but instead render the pathfinding visuals using Swift and SwiftUI, sadly it will have to wait until I get a Mac.

## Useful Theory

Today was also a no theory day, OpenGL really has been quite the new thing for me and it is definetly posing a major issue in terms of understanding what I'm doing. With time I am sure I will figure it out but for a first project it was indeed too much.

## Important Note

Keep in mind I am using VS Code on Ubuntu 24.04 to write my scripts so things may not be perfect or even functional.
As of right now switching to macOS on an apple device is my main goal so until then please be patient for any errors you may encounter.
