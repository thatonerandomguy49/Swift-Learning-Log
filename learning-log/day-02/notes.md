## Second Day's notes:

---

## Log-1:

First I made a simple class inheritance test just to see how they behave in swift, compared to game development they have no obvious difference so the c# experience probably helps keep things clean and simple.

---

## Log-2:

// So far no second projects as it seems to have concluded most of the basics

---

## EndLog 

---

## Useful Theory

// Nothing so far, since yesteday at least

## Important Note

Keep in mind I am using VS Code on Ubuntu 24.04 to write my scripts so things may not be perfect or even functional.
As of right now switching to macOS on an apple device is my main goal so until then please be patient for any errors you may encounter.
