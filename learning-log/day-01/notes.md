## First Day's notes:

---

I have started with some basic swift learning and made a simple script to check out how variables behave in swift and an if statement which I have simplified using a descriptive boolean in order to clean up the code.

I am following that script up with a basic swiftUI script to visualise a bit of what the finance tracker app will look like, or at least an initial inspiration, in order to learn a bit more about app development.

Keep in mind I am using VS Code on Ubuntu 24.04 to write my scripts so things may not be perfect or even functional.
As of right now switching to macOS on an apple device is my main goal so until then please be patient for any errors you may encounter.
